# Cline Rules

Write code to be DRY.
Use mkdocs for all documentation.
Always create interfaces that support dark and light mode switching.
Dev containers should not need restarting as they should be designed to reload on code changes.
To prevent code getting too large to manage consider breaking files down into logical sections.
